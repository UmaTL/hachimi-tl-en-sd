# Skill data descriptions
This is UmaTL's alternative translation repository using skill descriptions based on raw data extracted from the game.  
It is made for Hachimi and is otherwise identical to UmaTL's main translation repo.  
A version with only the skill descriptions is [here](https://github.com/UmaTL/hachimi-sd) but follows the same install steps.

# Install / Use
Follow the instructions at [UmaTL's main translation repository](https://github.com/UmaTL/hachimi-tl-en?tab=readme-ov-file#umamusume-english-translations) (follow the manual change method for the config).  
Hachimi's first-time setup will then allow you to select any of UmaTL's sources for modifying game text.  
Select either Skill Data option depending on if you would like to have translations as well.

> [!CAUTION] 
> Do **NOT** select translation repos if you play the global version.
